      <description>Recently, I have been experimenting with web scraping a lot, and after one too many session of just sitting around waiting for my requests to finish, I finally decided to see if there exists a better way. After some initial Googling I found out about two techniques known as parallelism and concurrency, and thus began my journey into learning about these two for the next few months. During that time, I noticed that several people, including me, were confused on what the difference between these two?</description>

      <description>I am extremely inquisitive by nature and have a habit of spending countless hours researching things that interest me, often taking the place of actual work. So I have decided to start this blog and turn those random research spirals into something useful. I aim to write interactive and visualization heavy articles on anything and everything that holds my interest, be it complex algorithms, computational geometry, rocket science, or anything in between!</description>
