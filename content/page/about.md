I am extremely inquisitive by nature and have a habit of spending countless hours  researching things that interest me, often taking the place of actual work. So I have decided to start this blog and turn those random research spirals into something useful. I aim to write interactive and visualization heavy articles on anything and everything that holds my interest, be it complex algorithms, computational geometry, rocket science, or anything in between! If you like what you see, do stick around :)

Happy reading!
