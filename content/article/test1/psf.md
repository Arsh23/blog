When the idea of this conference first came up in a meeting between NUMfocus and
the pydata team, everyone was undeniably nervous because we had just 2 months to
get it done. But we are happy to say now, that the first ever PyData conference in
India, PyData Delhi 2017, was a huge success!

We would like to take this opportunity to wrap-up this conference and get the
gears in motion for 2018.

## Talks

Although the CFP was open for a relatively short time, we had lots of quality
talks to choose from. Over the course of two days, we had:

- 5 amazing keynotes
- 2 talks tracks and 1 workshop track
- with 30 talks and 6 workshops
- 7 lightning talks
- and a great panel discussion

## Attendence

The python community in India took great interest in this conference, and we saw
great participation from around India, including:

- around 270 attendees
- from 29 cities all around India
- and 5 countries(IN, NL, US, UK, NP)

Some interesting insights we found while compiling these stats:

- 86% of the attendees were from a CS background
- 49.6% of the attendees said that PyData Delhi 2017 was their first conference
- 51.3% were students
- 34% were professionals
- 11.8% were speakers and workshop organizers
- 7.4% were volunteers 

## Diversity

We tried our best to make this conference as inclusive and enjoyable as possible
for all the attendees, and these stats surpassed our expectations:

- 21% of our attendees were female
- 17% of our speakers and workshop organizers were females

and the best of all-

- 45% of the organizing team were females!

## Comunity

This conference created a lot of hype around Python and Data science in India.
We met lots of enthusiastic people who were inspired to start a PyData chapter
in their cities too, with cities like:

- Mumbai
- Bangalore
- Kanpur
- Raipur
- Chennai

starting their own PyData chapters and taking the comunity forward.

We also saw great participation in the open spaces for PyData Delhi 2018, with
many new people being interested in volunteering for next year and helping with
our meetups

## Budget

In the spirit of Open Source and transparency, weâ€™re happy to share a summary of
our budget (all numbers in INR):
